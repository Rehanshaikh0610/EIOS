"""Normalized event contract.

Every EIOS signal source — Kafka orders, Prometheus metrics, the attack
generator — is flattened into this one shape before anything downstream sees
it. Detection, correlation and the dashboard all read NormalizedEvent and
never touch a source-specific format.

Bump SCHEMA_VERSION on any breaking field change.
